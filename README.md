# node-installer-docker_snapshot-extension
Note: This is an unofficial extension and is not affiliated with DLT.green.

This extension is designed for the node-installer-docker project by DLT.green. The DLT.green installer enables you to effortlessly deploy an IOTA or Shimmer Hornet node (among others) on your machine using Docker.

The script assists in downloading a snapshot for the Hornet node software, allowing you to initiate your ledger history from a particular timestamp.

## Prerequisites
Before executing the script, ensure you've already set up node-installer-docker from the following link:

https://github.com/dlt-green/node-installer-docker

*Note: This has not been tested with other installers like Tanglebay SWARM https://github.com/tanglebay/swarm*



## Usage
To fetch and initiate the script, input the command below:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xKtota/node-installer-docker_snapshot-extension/master/snapshot_extension.sh && sudo bash snapshot_extension.sh
```

Executing the command will pull the script from GitHub and initiate it using the bash command. Be aware that this script isn't an official extension of DLT.green; utilize it at your discretion.

Upon starting, the script will ask you to determine the node type you aim to deploy (IOTA or Shimmer) and will subsequently walk you through the snapshot download process and node setup.

Modify the script as needed to better align with your requirements. This script aims to serve as an enhancement for the node-installer-docker and not as a standalone installer.

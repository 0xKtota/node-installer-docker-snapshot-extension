# node-installer-docker_snapshot-extension
This is an unofficial extension for the *node-installer-docker* project by DLT.green. The installer of dlt.green allows you to easily run an IOTA or Shimmer Hornet node (and more) on your machine using Docker. 

This script helps you to download a snapshot for the Hornet node software, allowing you to start your ledger history from a specific point in time.


## Prerequisites
Before using the script, make sure that you have already installed the *node-installer-docker* from "https://github.com/dlt-green/node-installer-docker".


## Usage
To download and run the script, use the following command:


`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xKtota/node-installer-docker_snapshot-extension/master/snapshot_extension.sh && sudo bash snapshot_extension.sh`


This command will download the script from GitHub and run it using the bash command.
Please note that the script is not an official extension from DLT.green and use it at your own risk.

The script will prompt you to select the node type you want to run (Hornet, IOTA or Shimmer) and then guide you through the process of downloading a snapshot and setting up the node.

Feel free to modify the script to suit your needs and use it to help you run your node more easily. Please note that this script is intended as an extension for the node-installer-docker and not as a Swarm cluster.
